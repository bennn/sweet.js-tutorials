# sweet.js tutorials

This contains all the sweet.js tutorials from my [blog](http://jlongster.com) and a working sweet.js environment. Run `grunt` to compile all the `.sjs` files in `src`, and `grunt watch` to compile on change. Currently the available tutorials are:

* [Writing Your First Sweet.js Macro](http://jlongster.com/Writing-Your-First-Sweet.js-Macro): tutorials/1-overview.md
* [Sweet.js Tutorial #2: Recursive Macros and Custom Pattern Classes](http://jlongster.com/Sweet.js-Tutorial--2--Recursive-Macros-and-Custom-Pattern-Classes): tutorials/2-recurse-and-classes.md
